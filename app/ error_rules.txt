In this file the error numbers will be given so that debugging and understanding where the error is can become easier
Errors will be sent via perror but also via the log file.

Errno String is printed in the log file, each error has a thousandth and hundredth allocated for the different files, the errors are counted starting from 0

Template for an error:
[date] StockViewer error number
[date] errno string

**There are two errors that start before the log file is even opened, those errors are not counted into this file, they are simply 1 and 2**

For errors that happen when opening the log file, perror will be used as (obviously) the log file is unable to be opened.

logger does not return error numbers, it only returns






File hundredths:
1: main always returns 1011
2: Stock_Data
3: json
4: json parse active
5: json parse sentiment
6: json parse currencies
7: SQL Create
8: SQL Read
9: app
11: mainwindow
12: sidebar


There was an error when coding for the first time: error functions require an int return but the only int return possible is 0, making the return useless. Won't fix
